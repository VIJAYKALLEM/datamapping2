The Upper west side, Washington Heights,East Village and some parts of Harlem in Manhattan had the largest number of 311 noise complaints. The reason for these trends may be because these places have a high concentration of business and landmark sites. For example there are many complaints from the Chinatown area because it is a densely populated neighborhood that draws foodies and tourists. The busy sidewalks are packed with souvenir stores, bubble tea shops, and markets selling everything from fresh and dried fish to herbs and spices.

There is a high concentration of construction complaints in lower manhattan, upper west side and upper east side. And dog barking and other animal noise complaints are mostly concentrated in the upper west and east side around central park. Loud/music party complaints are concentrated in lower Manhattan(Chinatown) and Washington Heights.

When we compare early childhood and elementary schools with Ice-cream truck noises, there is a correlation between them.Maybe this is because young children are their target customers and they also consume the most ice creams. And ice cream trucks often use bell sounds to attract their customers and they make a lot of noise.
