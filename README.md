Upper west side, Washington Heights,East Village and some parts of Harlem in Manhattan had the largest number of 311 noise complaints. The reason for these trends may be because these places have high conectartion of bussiness and landmark sites. For example there are many complaints from Chinatown area because it is a densely populated neighborhood that draws foodies and tourists
